== Using a custom buildpack

. Review the documentation on http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/buildpacks/custom.html#deploying-with-custom-buildpacks[deploying with custom buildpacks] and how dependencies are handled with the Java Buildpack https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack#online-package[online package] and https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack#offline-package[offline package].
+
. Review the Java Version reported by `attendees`.
+

+
. Review which buildpack is in use.
+
----
$ cf app attendees
----
+
. `cd` into the directory that contains the attendees jar file and push `attendees` again, but this time specify a custom buildpack.  In this case, we will use the latest version of the https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack[Java Buildpack] on GitHub.
+
----
$ cf push attendees -p ./attendees.jar -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git
----
+
. Using your browser, refresh the `attendees` application.
+
It's likely (but not required) that the `Java Version` changed.

*What Just Happened?*

We instructed our application to use a custom buildpack (as opposed to a system provided one).

In this case, we used the Java Buildpack source on Github as our custom buildpack.
The Java Buildpack source is continuously updated and it is an https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack#online-package[online] package of the buildpack.
Meaning it has access to all dependencies via the network (it has access to all JRE versions, etc).  

Whereas, the system provided Java buildpack is https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack#offline-package[offline], with a limited set of dependencies.
For both the online and offline packages, unless the Java version is specified the application is run with the latest version of Java available to the buildpack.

== Change the Java version

. Review the Java Buildpack https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack#configuration-and-extension[configuration and extension documentation].

. Let's assume that we want to run `attendees` on a specific version Java.
+
----
$ cf set-env attendees JBP_CONFIG_OPEN_JDK_JRE "{jre: { version: 1.8.0_45 }}"
----
+
. Using your browser, refresh the `attendees` application.
+
*QUESTION:* Is the `attendees` running with `1.8.0_45`?  Why not?
+
. Restage `attendees`.
+
----
$ cf restage attendees
----
+
*QUESTION:* Would `cf restart` be sufficient instead of `cf restage`?  Why not?
+
. Using your browser, refresh the `attendees` application.

== Questions

* What other items are easily customized with the Java Buildpack?
* If you use Java, what items do you think would need customization in your environment?

== Create a Buildpack
. Read about adding buildpacks to your http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/buildpacks.html[Cloud Foundry Installation].
. Create a new buildpack using the Java buildpack https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/releases/download/v3.10/java-buildpack-offline-v3.10.zip[here], also located in the `Student Files` folder on your remote desktop. Ensure you are targeting your PCF installation and that you are logged in as admin.
+
`cd` into the directory that contains another buildpack, for example, and older version of the Java Buildpack, like 3.10, which you can download from here:
https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack/releases/tag/v3.10
+
For example:
+
----
$ cf create-buildpack super_awesome_java_pack ./java-buildpack-v3.10.zip 1
----
+
. Confirm that the buildpack was added.  Note: You must be a Cloud Foundry admin user to run the commands discussed in this section, which means this will not work on Pivotal Web Services (PWS).
+
----
$ cf buildpacks
----
*NOTE:* Notice the position of the super_awesome_java_pack we pushed.
+
. Navigate to your attendees application in the browser.  Note the Java version indicated in the Application Environment Information panel.
+
. `cd` into the folder containing `attendees`. From the commandline, run
+
----
$ cf push attendees-new-bp -p ./attendees.jar --random-route
----
+
. Navigate to the random-route created for `attendees-new-bp`. attendees has been rebuilt with your added buildpack.  Note any Java version changes.

== Questions

* What is the difference between using the `-b` flag on `cf push`, setting a Java version on an application's environment, and adding a buildpack using `create-buildpack`?

* How is the buildpack selected when running `cf push attendees-new-bp` and not specifying a buildpack?

* After adding the new buildpack, why wouldn't `cf restage attendees` or
`cf push attendees -p ./attendees.jar` get the new buildpack?

* What would have happened if we created the buildpack with a different position?
