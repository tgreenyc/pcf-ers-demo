Estimated Time: 1 hour

== Going Deeper with Ops Manager

. `ssh` to Ops Mgr.
+
You can do this from your local machine or the Remote Desktop with PuTTY. (Make sure to change the number to match your environment).
+
`PuTTY Tip:` Right-clicking in the PuTTY session window will paste the contents of the clipboard.  Control-v does _not_ work.
+
For example:
+
----
$ ssh ubuntu@opsmgr.haas-69.pez.pivotal.io
----
+
. Explore key directories.

Ops Manager is a rails application.  It is installed as a service called `tempest-web`.

Ops Manager is started out of the `/home/tempest-web` directory:

----
$ ls /home/tempest-web
----

Ops Manager uses the `/var/tempest` directory to store installation components:

----
$ ls /var/tempest
----

=== Questions

* What are some items located within the `/home/tempest-web` directory?
* What are some items located within the `/var/tempest` directory?

== Restarting Ops Manager

If your Ops Manager application becomes unresponsive, you may need to restart it.

**DO NOT DO THIS IF YOU HAVE AN UPDATE/INSTALL RUNNING**

. Restart Ops Manager.
+
----
$ sudo service tempest-web stop
----
+
. Browse to Ops Manager.  You should get a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#5xx_Server_Error">`502 Bad Gateway`</a> response.
+
. To resolve the problem start the `tempest-web` process.
+
----
$ sudo service tempest-web start
----
+
If you receive the message: `nohup: redirecting stderr to stdout`, you can safely `Control + C` to return you back to the prompt.
+
. Browse to Ops Manager.  You will be prompted to enter your decryption passphrase.
+

+
. Login to Ops Manager.

== Ops Manager Debug Endpoints

Ops Manager has a `debug` endpoint that can be useful when filing bug reports or troubleshooting.

. Navigate to `https://<YOUR_OPS_MGR>/debug`

* **Files:** contains a yml representation of your installation.
* **Product Metadata:** shows a summary of all installed components/tiles and their configuration.
* **Rails log:** shows a recent tail of the logs for the rails application.

== Using Bosh

. Review the documentation on http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html[Advanced Troubleshooting].

. Browse to the `Status` tab of the `Ops Manager Director` tile and record the IP.
+
image::ops-mgr-job-ip.png[]
+
. Browse to the `Credentials` tab of the `Ops Manager Director` tile.
+
Click `Link to Credential` and record the Director Credentials.
+
image::bosh-creds.png[]
+
. From within the Ops Manager web application VM (ubuntu@pivotal-ops-manager https://bosh.io/docs/sysadmin-commands.html#director[target] the `bosh` CLI.

----
$ bosh --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate target <IP-ADDRESS-FROM-STEP-2>
----

Use the credentials from `Step 3` to log in.


== Explore the `bosh` CLI

. View the <a target="_blank" href="https://bosh.io/docs/sysadmin-commands.html#deployment">deployments</a>.
+
Take note of the `cf-<GUID>` depoyment.
+
----
$ bosh deployments
----
+
. https://bosh.io/docs/sysadmin-commands.html#health[View the VMs] for each deployment.
+
Details and vitals can also be included.
+
----
$ bosh vms
$ bosh vms --details --vitals
----
+
. Review the documentation on <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#product">selecting a deployment to troubleshoot</a>.
+
. Set the `cf-<GUID>` deployment as the active deployment to work with.
+
You may see several `cf-<GUID>` deployment files.  Select the one that matches what you found in `Step 1`.
+
For example:
+
----
$ bosh deployment /var/tempest/workspaces/default/deployments/cf-f9931f31b2705d13e449.yml
----
+
. Review the https://bosh.io/docs/sysadmin-commands.html#director[status].
+
----
$ bosh status
----
+
. Review the <a target="_blank" href="https://bosh.io/docs/sysadmin-commands.html#health">process information</a> for the `cf-<GUID>` deployment.
+
----
$ bosh instances --ps
----

=== Questions

* What are the deployments that BOSH is managing.
* Where in Ops Manager are the vitals exposed for a deployment?

== BOSH Resurrector

. Review the documentation on http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/bosh/disaster-recovery.html[disaster recovery].
+
. From the Remote Desktop, login to vCenter.
+
. Delete the `router` VM.
+
To find it easily, select the `Hosts and Cluster` view.  On the left hand navigation, expand your vCenter IP address and `Datacenter` and select your RP01.
+
image::host-and-cluster-view.png[]
+
Open the `Virtual Machines` tab and scroll to the right and use the `job` column.
+
* Right click on the VM
* Select `Power` â†’ `Power Off`
* Right click on the VM
* Select `Delete from Disk`
+
image::delete-router.png[]
+
. View the health of the deployment and watch it recover.

----
$ bosh vms cf-<GUID>
----

You can also monitor the vCenter Task pane to see the VM being recreated.

![Task Pane](task-pane.png)

=== Questions

* How is this different from how you would recover in the same situation today?

== Bosh Cloudcheck

. Turn the https://bosh.io/docs/sysadmin-commands.html#health[resurrector off]. Further reading on the Bosh resurrector is available http://bosh.io/docs/resurrector.html[here].
+
----
$ bosh vm resurrection off
----
+
. Delete the `router` VM again.
. View the health of the deployment.
+
----
$ bosh vms cf-<GUID>
----
+
. Use http://bosh.io/docs/disaster-recovery.html#manual[BOSH Cloudcheck] to recover https://bosh.io/docs/sysadmin-commands.html#health[manually].
+
When prompted choose the option `Recreate VM`.
+
----
$ bosh cck
----
+
. Confirm the health of the deployment.
+
----
$ bosh vms cf-<GUID>
----
+
. Turn the resurrector on.
+
----
$ bosh vm resurrection on
----
+
=== Questions

* What items does `bosh cck` scan?

== Bosh Logging

. Get the agent and job https://bosh.io/docs/sysadmin-commands.html#logs[logs] for the Cloud Controller.
+
(make sure you are in your home directory - or a directory you have write permissions to - when running the following commands)
+
Get the values for the parameters with `bosh vms`.
+
For Example:
+
----
$ bosh logs --agent cloud_controller-partition-76b1edb0930bd9164d8e 0
$ bosh logs --job cloud_controller-partition-76b1edb0930bd9164d8e 0
----
+
. Download the logs to examine them.

Use an SCP client of your choosing (`scp`, <http://www.putty.org[PuTTY], https://winscp.net/eng/download.php[WinSCP]).

The following are instructions for WinSCP, which you can use from your remote desktop:

From your desktop click on the WinSCP shortcut.

In the form, enter the following values (if a value is not specified, accept the defaults).

|===
| Field        | Value

| File protocal  | SCP
| Host name | opsmgr.haas-[NN].pez.pivotal.io
| User name | ubuntu
| password  | (provided by your instructor)
|===

Click `Login`.

Download the logs you have created by selecting the file and clicking `Download`.

image::download-log.png[]

Unpack the logs and explore!

=== Question
* Are these logs equivalent to those downloadable via Ops Manager?

== Monit basics

Bosh uses http://mmonit.com/monit[monit] to manage https://bosh.io/docs/vm-monit.html#using-monit[running processes] on VMs.

. Review the directions on http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#bosh-ssh[bosh ssh].
. `bosh ssh` to ssh into a Diego cell.
+
----
$ bosh ssh
----
+
. Switch to `root`.
+
----
$ sudo -i
----
+
. Explore the `/var/vcap` directory.
+
This is the main directory where bosh installs everything.
+
----
$ ls /var/vcap
----
+
. Pull a monit summary.
+
----
$ /var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit summary
----
+
. Pull a monit status.
+
----
$ /var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit status
----
+
. Locate the `pid` from the `monit status` output.
+
image::bosh-troubleshooting-rep-pid.png[]
+
. Kill the `rep` process.
+
----
$ kill -9 <pid>
----
+
. Watch monit recover the process.
+
This will happen quickly, so move quickly or open multiple terminal windows and start the `watch` before killing the process.
+
----
$ watch /var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit summary
----
+
`Control + C` to stop the `watch`.
+
. Repeat killing the `rep` process and view the effects in `Pivotal Elastic Runtime` tile `Status` tab within Ops Manager.
+
