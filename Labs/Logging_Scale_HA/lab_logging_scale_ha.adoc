How PCF facilitates application management, including: access application 
logs, scale an application, access events and handle failed application 
instances
--

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

== Access Application Logs

Review the documentation on http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-11/devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html[application logs].

You can tail the logs:
----
$ cf logs attendees
----

Then open a browser and view the _attendees_ application.

Observe the log output when the _attendees_ web page is refreshed. 
More logs are added!

To stop tailing logs, go to the terminal tailing the logs and send an
interrupt (Control + c).

=== Questions
* Where should your application write logs?
* What are some of the different origin codes seen in the log?
* How does this change how you access logs today? At scale?

== Access _attendees_ events
Events for the application can also be used to compliment the logs in determining what has occurred with an application.
----
$ cf events attendees
----

== Scale _attendees_
=== Scale Up
. Start tailing the logs again.
+
----
[mac, linux]
$ cf logs attendees | grep "API\|CELL"

[windows]
$ cf logs attendees | findstr "API CELL"
----
+
The above statement filters only matching log lines from the Cloud Controller 
and Cell components.
+
. In another terminal window scale attendees. 
----
$ cf scale attendees -m 1G
----
. Observe log output.
. Stop tailing the logs.
. Scale attendees back to our original settings.
----
$ cf scale attendees -m 768M
----
=== Scale Out
. Browse to the _Scale and HA_ page on the _attendees_ application.
+
image::screenshot_scaleAndHA.png[]
+
Review the _Application Environment Information_. 
+
. Press the `Refresh` button multiple times. All requests are going to one application instance.
. Start tailing the logs.
+
----
[mac, linux]
$ cf logs attendees | grep "API\|CELL"

[windows]
$ cf logs attendees | findstr "API CELL"
----
+
. In another terminal windows, scale _attendees_ application.
+
----
$ cf scale attendees -i 3
----
+
. Observe log output. Then stop tailing the logs.
. Return to `attendees` in a web browser. Press the `Refresh` button several times. Observe the `Addresses` 
and `Instance Index` changing.
+
_Notice how quickly the new application instances are provisioned and subsequently load balanced!_

=== Questions

* How long does it take to scale up or out applications now?


== High Availability
Pivotal Cloud Foundry has https://content.pivotal.io/blog/the-four-levels-of-ha-in-pivotal-cf[4 levels of HA] (High Availability) that keep your applications and the underlying platform running. In this section, we will demonstrate one of them. Failed application instances will be recovered.
+
. At this time you should be running multiple instances of `attendees`. Confirm this with the following command:
----
$ cf app attendees
----
. Return to `attendees` in a web browser and navigate to the Scale and HA page. Press the Refresh button. Confirm the application is running.
. Kill the app. Press the Kill button!
. Check the state of the app through the cf CLI.
----
$ cf app attendees
----
Sample output below (notice the requested state vs actual state). In this case, Pivotal Cloud Foundry had already detected the failure and is starting a new instance.

Repeat this command as necessary until `state = running`.
. In your browser, Refresh the articulate application.
The app is back up!

A new, healthy app instance has been automatically provisioned to replace the failing one.

. View which instance was killed.
----
$ cf events attendees
----
. Scale articulate back to our original settings.
----
$ cf scale attendees -i 1
----

=== Questions
* How do you recover failing application instances today?
* What effect does this have on your application design?
* How could you determine if your application has been crashing?

== Beyond the class
Try the same exercises, but using Apps Manager instead
